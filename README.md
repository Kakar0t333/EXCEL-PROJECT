This project aims to create a dashboard to visualize and analyze road accident data, providing insights into the frequency, severity and contributing factors of accidents. Utilizing pivot tables, I was able to aggregate and dissect the data effectively. The dashboard provides a valuable tool for understanding the factors contributing to road accidents and developing strategies to improve road safety.
